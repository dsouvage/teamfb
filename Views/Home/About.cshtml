        <p>There will always be a variety of things going on when you are a small business owner. Handling so many tasks at once and not letting work get messy is a challenge. That&#39;s why it makes sense for organizations to start using applications for management.</p>
        <p>These days, more and more businesses or organisations are investing in software for business management to predict risks, manage inventory, handle invoicing, and increase overall business efficiency.</p>
        <p>We are proposing a solution to this problem by developing a web application that small business owners can use to easily manage their small business without the overhead that can come with an overly complex solution, getting to the point quickly, allowing for quick onboarding and ease of effective use of the software.</p>

        <p>The goal of this application is to provide an intuitive and accessible application that small business owners can use to effectively manage their business without adding additional overhead costs and help minimize stress. By providing an easy to understand system, the application will aid owners in managing and organizing the more mundane and confusing aspects of operating a business.</p>
        <p>Components such as order and product fulfillment, finance ledger, statistical insights, and hourly log will enable the owner to increase their general oversight of each business process without increasing overhead. Statistical analysis and graphics will help owners better visualize and track their performance, or target areas which require more attention.</p>
        <p>Small businesses will enable themselves to quickly and effectively organize their own business processes by utilizing this software. Instead of the owner having to deal with multiple complex pieces of software to manage each sector of their business, our product aims to simplify the process into an easy to navigate UI with everything in one place.</p>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected countless small businesses, and isolated them from support services they may have been using previously. By creating an easy to understand application, these owners will have the option to reduce additional costs and perform these services independently.</p>
        <p>Reducing the amount of time and complexity revolving around the management of business processes will result in saving the owner money, while also improving their experience as small business owners.</p>
        <p>Small businesses bring innovation and growth to our economy. They require help now more than ever during current world events. We aim to have our small business management system lend a helping hand during these unprecedented times.</p>
